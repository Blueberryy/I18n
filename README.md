# The FrankerFaceZ Localization Project

## Welcome!

Want to help translate FrankerFaceZ into your language? This isn't quite the
right place. We manage translations using [Weblate](https://weblate.frankerfacez.com/)
while this repository acts as a sort of back end storage and update system.

Please [find us on Discord](https://discord.gg/UrAkGhT) and ask about
translation to get started.


## I've Found a Typo

Please report localization issues on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UrAkGhT).
Our community translators are all there and can be reached about fixing any
issues that way.


## What Is This Place?

This repository contains all localizable strings for the FrankerFaceZ project,
as well as all translations. This repository is intended for use with Weblate.

All updates to this repository are synced with Weblate, and when translations
are approved on Weblate, they're sent back here to this repository. When that
happens, CI actions are used to deploy the updated strings to our CDN.
